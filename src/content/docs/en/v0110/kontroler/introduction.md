<h4>Welcome to the kontroler!</h4>

Kontroler is a Kubernetes-native DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) management and creation tool built to streamline the orchestration of complex workflows in modern cloud-native environments.

Kontroler integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, leveraging its core capabilities—such as autoscaling, high availability, and container orchestration—to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant solution for creating and managing DAGs. Whether you're orchestrating data pipelines, automating tasks, or managing multi-step workflows, Kontroler ensures reliable execution and simplifies workflow management directly within your Kubernetes ecosystem.

Documentation coming soon!

## Alpha Development

Kontroler is currently in its Alpha Development phase. While we strive to maintain API stability, there may still be changes as the project evolves. We cannot fully guarantee that breaking changes will not be introduced during this stage of development.

We advise caution when using Kontroler in production environments. As the API and roadmap continue to mature, there are limited testing frameworks beyond the core functionality of Kontroler. However, we are actively working to enhance stability and expand test coverage as the platform evolves.

## Want to Get involved?

We welcome and greatly appreciate community support for the development of Kontroler! While we currently do not have official communication channels in place, these will be available soon.

In the meantime, feel free to explore our project on <a href="https://github.com/GreedyKomodoDragon/kontroler">Github space</a>. Your contributions, feedback, and insights are invaluable to us as Kontroler continues to evolve!
